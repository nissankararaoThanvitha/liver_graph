summary = f"""# Idea 4 — drug–gene links missing from the knowledge graph (outside databases)

**Gene set:** corrected Paper 1 union of 6,222 progression genes (earlier plans cite 4,692, the pre-correction count).
**Status:** separate, clearly labelled layer. The graph-only results (Tasks 1–8, revised Tasks 5 and 7) and Neo4j are **unchanged**.
This uses data from outside the knowledge graph, so the supervisor should approve before it is used in the paper.

## In one sentence
Outside databases list **{M['pairs']:,} drug–gene links for approved or clinical-trial medicines** (curated drug-target evidence) on our genes that the graph does not have; they reach **{M['new_genes']:,} progression genes that have no drug at all in the graph** (genes with a drug: {n['genes_with_drug_graph']:,} → {n['genes_with_drug_graph_plus_new']:,}).

## Sources searched (all free)
| Source | Version | How genes were matched |
|---|---|---|
| IUPHAR/BPS Guide to Pharmacology | {n['release']['GtoPdb']} | Ensembl ID (human, endogenous ligands removed) |
| DGIdb | {n['release']['DGIdb']} | HGNC symbol (whole database, kept for our genes) |
| ChEMBL drug mechanisms | {n['release']['ChEMBL']} | gene symbol of human targets |
| Open Targets Platform | {n['release']['OpenTargets']} (latest) | Ensembl ID |

Each drug is reduced to its ChEMBL parent compound (salts count once). A link is **new** if the graph has no Drug–[ACTS_ON]→Gene link for that drug and gene (all {len(e):,} graph links on our genes were compared).

## Does the matching work? (positive control)
- The graph's {ot_ctrl['OpenTargets'][1]:,} links that came from Open Targets: Open Targets finds **{ot_ctrl['OpenTargets'][0]:,} ({100 * ot_ctrl['OpenTargets'][0] / ot_ctrl['OpenTargets'][1]:.0f}%)**, ChEMBL finds **{ot_ctrl['ChEMBL'][0]:,} ({100 * ot_ctrl['ChEMBL'][0] / ot_ctrl['ChEMBL'][1]:.0f}%)**.
- Neo4j spot check (live graph, 21 Oct 2026): 120 random "new" links → **0** have any Drug–Gene relationship in Neo4j; 150 random new-link drugs → 121 already exist as Drug nodes but only 7 have any ACTS_ON link. So the graph knows most of these drugs but is missing their targets.

{md(ctrl)}

## Two errors found in DGIdb and removed
1. **DGIdb's copy of Guide to Pharmacology is on the wrong genes.** Guide to Pharmacology target numbers were read as NCBI gene numbers (target 215 = dopamine D2 receptor, but NCBI gene 215 = ABCD1). All {6095:,} such rows on our genes were dropped; Guide to Pharmacology is used directly instead.
2. **DGIdb's copy of ChEMBL keeps virus and bacteria targets** matched by short names (hepatitis B polymerase "P" → human OCA2). These {4748:,} rows were dropped; ChEMBL is used directly with human targets only.

## How good is the evidence? (all new links)
{md(ev)}

- **curated drug-target**: Guide to Pharmacology, ChEMBL, Open Targets, or DGIdb sources that give the gene by symbol/UniProt (TEND, TALC, FDA, clinical-trial target lists). **Used for the headline numbers.**
- **TTD only**: curated, but TTD matches genes from protein names, which sometimes goes wrong (e.g. "KIR" → GEM). Kept, not in the headline.
- **lab binding screen** (Drug Target Commons): measured binding in an assay; mostly research compounds.
- **literature / biomarker only** (NCI, PharmGKB, CIViC, cancer knowledge bases): "drug is related to gene" (response, resistance, expression), **not** "drug acts on gene". Not counted as a target.

## By source
{md(src)}

## Headline: new links for medicines with curated evidence
| | links | drugs | genes | genes with NO drug in the graph before |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| approved or clinical trial | {M['pairs']:,} | {M['drugs']:,} | {M['genes']:,} | **{M['new_genes']:,}** |
| …approved only | {A['pairs']:,} | {A['drugs']:,} | {A['genes']:,} | {A['new_genes']:,} |

- {n['medicine_pairs_2plus_sources']:,} of {M['pairs']:,} links ({100 * n['medicine_pairs_2plus_sources'] / M['pairs']:.0f}%) are reported by two or more sources.
- {fib_new:,} of the {M['new_genes']:,} newly reached genes are fibrosis genes (fibrosis-only or shared); **{len(t1)} are Tier 1** (high confidence).
- Push direction is known for {n['medicine_pairs_with_direction']:,} links: **{int(cons.get('direction-consistent', 0)):,} direction-consistent**, {int(cons.get('direction-inconsistent', 0)):,} inconsistent (same rule as Task 7).

{md(cls)}

## What it would change for repurposing (if adopted)
- **{n['task4_candidates_gaining_links']:,}** existing Task 4 candidates gain new target genes; {n['task4_candidates_gaining_consistent_link']:,} gain a direction-consistent link.
- Task 4 candidates with at least one direction-consistent link: graph only **{n['candidates_with_consistent_link_before']:,}** → with the 297 external directions **{n['candidates_with_consistent_link_graph_plus_297_layer']:,}** → with the new links as well **{n['candidates_with_consistent_link_all_layers']:,}**.
- **{n['new_task4_style_candidates']:,}** medicines would become *new* candidates under the Task 4 rule (phase ≥ 2, no liver use in the graph, acts on ≥ 1 progression gene); {n['new_task4_style_candidates_approved']:,} are approved and {n['new_task4_style_candidates_with_consistent_link']:,} have a direction-consistent link. (Withdrawn status was not re-checked for these.)

### Drugs already tested against fibrosis that the graph was missing (sanity check)
| Gene | Drug | found | push | Task 7 rule |
|---|---|---|---|---|
{chr(10).join(ex_rows)}

These are drugs that have been tested against fibrosis (pamrevlumab in lung fibrosis, belapectin in NASH cirrhosis, αv-integrin blockers), which suggests the new layer adds real biology, not noise.

**Limit of the simple direction rule:** soluble guanylate cyclase stimulators (riociguat, vericiguat, praliciguat) are found on GUCY1A1 / GUCY1B1 but are labelled *{sgc_note}*: these genes rise with fibrosis and the drugs push them up, yet sGC stimulation reduces fibrosis in animal models. A rising gene is not always a harmful gene; direction labels should be read with biology in mind.

## Caveats
- Outside data; supervisor approval needed before use. The knowledge-graph-only results stay the main result.
- Protein-complex targets are expanded to every subunit gene (e.g. proteasome, tubulin, CD3), as the graph itself does; antibody–drug conjugates (…vedotin) also hit tubulin through their payload.
- A few drugs appear twice (salt or prodrug with its own ChEMBL parent, or a DGIdb RxNorm ID that could not be matched to ChEMBL).
- Literature-only and TTD-only links are listed but not counted in the headline.
- "No liver use" uses the graph's TREATS / OFF_LABEL_FOR links to the 161 liver diseases, as in Task 4.
