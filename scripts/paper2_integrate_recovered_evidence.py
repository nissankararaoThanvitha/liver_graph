paper2_integrate_recovered_evidence.py
--------------------------------------
Fold the recovered OptimusKG evidence and chemistry into Tasks 2, 4 and 7.

WHAT THIS FIXES
Three things the plan asked for and the tasks could not supply, because
build_optimuskg_layer.py read them and kept only `name` and `relation`:

  Task 2  Evidence/Source and Database ID      said "not available per edge"
  Task 7  Evidence source and evidence level   said "not recorded"
  Task 4  filter on molecule type and phase    impossible; name heuristic only

All three are now answerable from OptimusKG's own source files, with ChEMBL
filling the structure gap OptimusKG leaves.

RUN ORDER
This runs AFTER the task scripts, and rewrites their outputs in place. Re-running
a task script drops the recovered columns, so re-run this afterwards. Paper 1
documents the same pattern for its own multi-pass steps.

    paper2_task2_drug_gene_edges.py
    paper2_task4_drug_coverage.py
    paper2_task7_action_direction.py
    paper2_integrate_recovered_evidence.py     <- this

WHAT IT DOES NOT DO
It does not re-rank anything. Tasks 3, 5, 6 and 8 are untouched, and the
candidate list is unchanged: this adds provenance and chemistry columns, not
new relationships. Any change to rankings would need its own pass and its own
verification.
