paper2_write_recovered_to_graph.py
----------------------------------
Write the two recoveries back onto the graph: drug properties on Drug nodes,
per-edge evidence on ACTS_ON relationships.

WHY HERE AND NOT ON GENE NODES
Nothing recovered is gene-level. It is drug-level (structure, molecule type,
clinical phase) or edge-level (asserting databases, reference URLs, written
mechanisms). Gene nodes are also the one place in this graph where duplicating
derived data has already gone wrong: `fibrosis_rho` sits on 3,645 Gene nodes
while 3,845 carry a TRACKS_FIBROSIS edge, and 191 have the property with no
edge. Two copies of one number, drifted apart.

Drug nodes carry `name` and `node_id` and nothing else; ACTS_ON carries
`action` and nothing else. There is no second copy to drift from, which is what
makes these two safe targets and Gene nodes an unsafe one.

SAFETY
This script is additive and reversible by construction:

  * It only ever SETs keys that do not already exist. Before writing it counts
    every target key across the graph and REFUSES to run if any is present,
    so it can never overwrite Team 1's data or its own earlier run.
  * It writes nothing without --apply. The default is a dry run that reports
    exactly what would change.
  * --rollback removes exactly the keys this script sets, and nothing else.
  * Values come from paper2_integrate_recovered_evidence.load_drug_metadata(),
    the same function that produced the delivered CSVs, so the graph cannot
    disagree with the tables.

Properties carry their provenance. Every recovered field that can come from
either recovery gets a companion *_source property naming which one supplied
it, exactly as the CSV columns do -- the mentor's instruction of 13 October was
to keep the two separate, and that has to survive into the graph.

`name` is never touched. Where OptimusKG stored an accession instead of a name,
the recovered name is written to `recovered_name` beside it, not over it.

Usage:
    uv run --with neo4j --with pandas python scripts/paper2_write_recovered_to_graph.py
    uv run --with neo4j --with pandas python scripts/paper2_write_recovered_to_graph.py --apply
    uv run --with neo4j --with pandas python scripts/paper2_write_recovered_to_graph.py --rollback
